Version 1.0

This simple batch file can be run from the command line to help speed up your switching between the real game and the trainer. 


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
1. You will need a copy of the games official Assembly-CSharp.dll file(found in the games install directory). You will also need a copy of the trainer DLL file(not sure what this is? check the discord). Save those two files where ever is convienient. 
2. Once you've done that, edit the MessengerTrainerToggleBat.properties file in this directory and supply the locations necessary in each of the properties. I have left my locations in there as an example.


HOW TO RUN THE BATCH

You will open a Command Prompt on your computer and change to this directory(cd) that contains the .bat file. Then you will run the batch, giving it an argument to tell it which file you want to load:


Command to install real game DLL - MessengerTrainerToggle.bat real

Command to install trainer DLL - MessengerTrainerToggle.bat trainer
